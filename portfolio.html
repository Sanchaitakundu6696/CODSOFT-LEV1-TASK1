            <h2>1. ARDUINO BASED VOICE CONTROLLED CAR</h2>
            <p>This project was developed in a way that the robot is controlled by voice commands. An android application with a microcontroller is used for required tasks. The connection between the android app and the vehicle is facilitated with Bluetooth technology. The robot is controlled by buttons on the application or by spoken commands of the user. The movement of the robot is facilitated by the two dc servo motors connected with microcontroller at the receiver side. The commands from the application is converted into digital signals by the Bluetooth RF transmitter for an appropriate range (about 100 meters) to the robot. At the receiver end the data gets decoded by the receiver and is fed to the microcontroller which drives the DC motors for the necessary work. The aim of Voice Controlled Robotic Vehicle is to perform the required task by listening to the commands of the user. A prior preparatory session is needed for the smooth operation the robot by the user. For the same a code is used for giving instruction to the controller.</p>

            <h2>3. HANGMAN GAME</h2>
            <p>Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.The Hangman Game in Python is written in a python programming language, in this Hangman Game Project is to implement the Hangman Game Using Python. It doesnâ€™t require any specific modules other than random and time. Python loops and functions are enough to build this game.A Hangman Game on Python is about guessing letters (A-Z) to form the words. If the player guesses the right letter that is within the word, the letter appears at its correct position. The user has to guess the correct word until a man is hung, then the game is over. </p>
